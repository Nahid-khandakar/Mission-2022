                <h3>Mission</h3>

                <p>
                    A mission statement is a statement that defines your values, who you are on how you define success.
                    A personal mission statement can be used to guide your decisions and help you.

                    If you have never heard of Oprah Winfrey and her love of vision boards, then I suspect you’ve been
                    living under a rock for the last 30 years. Oprah is an incredibly successful businesswoman.

                <p>
                    Life is full of challenges, successes and problems. Maybe you are extremely happy right now, maybe
                    you are sick, you have problems or you are struggling with financial
                    challenges.
